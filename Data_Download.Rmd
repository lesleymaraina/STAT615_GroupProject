Data Description:

Over 14000 variables [CDC and NY combined]

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
covid19 <- read.csv("../data/NYT_us-counties.csv")
cdc_svid <- read.csv("../data/SVI2018_US_COUNTY.csv")
```


```{r}
head(cdc_svid)
```


```{r}
head(covid19)
```


```{r}
names(state.abb) <- state.name
covid19$ST_ABBR <- state.abb[covid19$state]

```

```{r}
cdc_svid %>%
    rename("county" = "COUNTY") %>%
    rename("state" = "STATE") %>%
    inner_join(covid19, by=c("county", "ST_ABBR")) -> merged_df

head(merged_df)
dim(merged_df)
```


```{r}
merged_df
write.table(merged_df, file="../data/MergedDF_Oct122020COVID19_CDCSVI_CountyData.tsv", sep = '\t', row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```


**Notes From Oct 12 2020 Meeting with Professor Lu**
```{r}
# Multiple Linear Regression
# Outcome: COVID19 Deaths
mdl <- lm(deaths ~ population_var1 + income_var2 + age_var3)
```


- consider including interaction term
- explain how lasso is relevant to regression analysis and explain connection to ridge regression
  - central idea: explain connection to shrinkage
  
Data Analysis Project Proposal [Due Date TBD ~ Oct 19]

- 1 page description
- List project interests
- List relevant variables
- Possible factors associated with response variable (cummulative COVID19 deaths)
- Predictors being considered
- County level data
- Multiple linear regression
- LASSO for feature selection
- evaluating whether certain variables may have interactions or how they affect outcomes

**Project Update**

Project 1:

- General check in 
- describe what has been done since the inital proposal

Project 2:

- General check in 
- describe what has been done since the inital proposal

TODO: 

Convert state names from all caps to camelcase or vice versa
  + must merge dataframe based on county and state. Some counties may have redundant names

Select features of interest in the merged dataframe
