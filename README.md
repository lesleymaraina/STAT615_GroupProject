Project Overview
-----------------
Our project will determine the effects of population density and COVID19 cases and deaths in the United States. We will also determine how other factors such as income and poverty levels affect the association between population density and COVID19 cases and deaths.

Our central aim sub aims include testing the following the following hypotheses:

+ **Central Aim 1**: Population density in the form of crowding affect the number of COVID19 cases and deaths

+ **Sub Aim 2**: Age (citizens over 65 and under 17) are factors that the effects of influence of population density on the number of COVID19 cases and deaths in the US

+ **Sub Aim 3**: Age, income, and poverty level are factors that the effects of influence of population density on the number of COVID19 cases and deaths in the US


Data
----
[NY Times COVID19 Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

COVID19 cases and deaths in the United States will be determined based on live data collected by the NY Times. Data will be collected and analyzed for all cases and deaths up until a group determined date. The COVID19 cases and deaths listed on a county level for each state within the United States.

[CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html)

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has created a series of features that describe how certain communities might be more vulnerable than others when natural disasters or hazardous events occur. These data will be used to determine how external factors such as population density, age and income might effect the number of COVID19 cases and deaths within the United States.

The features used to describe community vulnerability are as follows:

+ Socioeconomic Status
  + Below Poverty
  + Unemployed
  + Income

+ Household Composition & Disability
  + Aged 65 or Older
  + Aged 17 or Younger

+ Housing Type & Transportation
  + Multi-Unit Structures
  + Mobile Homes
  + Crowding
  + No Vehicle
  + Group Quarters
